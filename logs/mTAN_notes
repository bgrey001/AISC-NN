Notes on my implementation of the mTAN network for AIS data


So far:

- Read the paper
- Researched attention, encoders and decoders further
- Outlined the difference between learning the time embeddings and using positional encodings (an alternative option)
- Broken down data structures for Human Activity set (couldn't access MIMIC III)
- Processed AIS data to have similar structure to serve as input to mTAN
- Taken the relevant modules from mTAN code base, i.e. the multi time attention and encoder modules
- Customised the GRU and classifier fc layers to improve performance for the AIS data
- Running experiments now

Issues:
- VERY slow due to sequence size being so much longer and the attention mechanism requiring slow matrix multiplication using 2931 x 5 vectors (compared to 50x12)
- Can't batch more than 20 due to limitation of VRAM for GPU
- Vanishing gradient
	Switched optimizer to AdamW to bring in weight decay and reduced learning rate from 0.01 to 0.0003

Results:

Experiment 1:
Time per epoch = 50 minutes
Epoch 1 - accuracy 72%
Epoch 2 - accuract 80%

Promising results, just slow!
